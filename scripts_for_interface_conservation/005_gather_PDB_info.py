# # Gather PDB info
# 
# This script will create a table summarizing the information I can get from the PDB files. Such a final table will have the following columns:
# 
# - P1_ID
# - P2_ID
# - Duplication type
# - Monomer_P1 (the ID of a PDB structure that shows the P1 monomer or NA if there is none in my set)
# - Monomer_P2 (the ID of a PDB structure that shows the P2 monomer or NA if there is none in my set)
# - HM_P1 (the ID of a PDB structure whose biological assembly is not a monomer AND has at least two copies of P1)
# - HM_P2 (the ID of a PDB structure whose biological assembly is not a monomer AND has at least two copies of P2)
# - HET (the ID of a PDB structure whose biological assembly is not a monomer AND has at least one copy of each of P1 and P2)
# - P1_unspecific (1 if P1 is in the list of structures with unspecific interactions in Tarassov's data, 0 otherwise)
# - P2_unspecific (1 if P2 is in the list of structures with unspecific interactions in Tarassov's data, 0 otherwise)

# ## Overall plan
# 
# - Write a script to extract the following from each of the PDB files I could download
#     - REMARK 350: Number of subunits in assembly 1 (monomeric, dimeric, etc)
#     - Resolution (I can optionally use this as a filter, say make sure all the structures have a resolution of 3 Ã… or better)
# - Load table with data about the files I could not download
# - Load table with alignment data for all SSD, WGD hits
# - Apply filters
# - Match the tables
